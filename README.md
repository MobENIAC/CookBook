# Cook Book

This project demonstrates our skillset as .NET Full-Stack Developers. After 3-months of intense learning at Salt School of Applied Technology, we were given 10 days for creating our final project. 

Cook book is a website where user can browse through recipes, and by logging in, the user can add recipes, edit and delete their own recipes, create a meal plan for the week as well as generate a shopping list based on the weekly meal.

In this project, we have an external API suggesting ingredients while the user is adding a recipe. We have also used OpenAI - if the user leaves the instructions empty while creating a recipe, the OpenAI implementation will create a recipe instructions for the user.
